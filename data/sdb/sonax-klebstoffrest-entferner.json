  "hazards_description": "Classified as Aerosol 1 – extremely flammable aerosol (H222) and pressurized container that may burst when heated (H229, H280). Causes severe eye irritation (H319) and may cause drowsiness and dizziness (STOT SE 3, H336).[attached_file:file:15] Composition: 50–75% 1-Methoxy-2-propanol (CAS 107-98-2, Flam. Liq. 3 H226, STOT SE 3 H336, LD50 oral 4016 mg/kg, dermal 2000 mg/kg); 25–50% 2-Propanol (CAS 67-63-0, Flam. Liq. 2 H225, Eye Irrit. 2 H319, STOT SE 3 H336, LD50 oral 5840 mg/kg, dermal 13900 mg/kg, LC50 inhal. 25 mg/L); 5–10% n-Butan (CAS 106-97-8, Flam. Gas 1A H220, Press. Gas H280); 5–10% Propan (CAS 74-98-6, Flam. Gas 1A H220, Press. Gas H280); 1–3% Isobutan (CAS 75-28-5, Flam. Gas 1A H220, Press. Gas H280); 5–15% aliphatic hydrocarbons.[attached_file:file:15] Flammable liquid and vapours form explosive mixtures with air; 85 wt% flammable constituents, combustion heat ≥30 kJ/g.",
  "protective_measures": "Use only in well-ventilated areas or outdoors. Ensure adequate workplace ventilation (local exhaust ventilation can be achieved through ventilation or general exhaust). Avoid inhalation of aerosol and contact with eyes and skin. Do not eat, drink, or smoke during handling. Wash hands thoroughly before breaks and after work. Wear safety goggles (EN 166), protective clothing (appropriate for solvent contact), and if necessary respiratory protection (Type A filter for organic vapours/gases, EN 14387) when workplace limit is exceeded.[attached_file:file:15] Do not pierce or burn the container, even after use. Keep away from heat, hot surfaces, sparks, open flames, and ignition sources; storage temperature must not exceed 50 °C. Store in a cool, well-ventilated location in tightly sealed containers away from incompatible materials (strong oxidizing agents, strong acids). Storage classification TRGS 510: Class 2B (pressurized containers).[attached_file:file:15]",
  "emergency_procedures": "For accidental release: Ensure adequate ventilation; eliminate all ignition sources. Do not allow open flames or smoking. Contain spillage with absorbent material (sand, diatomaceous earth, acid binder, universal binder, sawdust), collect in suitable containers, and dispose as hazardous waste. Prevent entry into drains, groundwater, or surface waters; notify authorities if contamination occurs.[attached_file:file:15] For fire: Use alcohol-resistant foam, CO₂, dry powder, or water mist (avoid full water jet). Wear complete protective suit and self-contained breathing apparatus. Cool exposed containers with water spray. Collect contaminated firefighting water separately. Hazards: Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide; explosive gas-air mixtures form during use.[attached_file:file:15]",
